GEOTEC_1.2 is discontinued, this is the final release. If you want to make a game with this, go ahead, personally I would not reccomend doing that. If you want to do anything with this, you should do the following:

- add more tiles
- add add a mixer and some music
- if you are not on windows, compile the Launcher for your os
- make rudimentary adventure maps and rpg games.
- make rudimentary platformer maps and create an implementation of gravity

I hope you enjoy this mess of a map editor and have fun messing around in it.
