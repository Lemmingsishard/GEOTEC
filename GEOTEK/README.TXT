Context - maybe_geotek is GEOTEC 1.0 but the version number in the program says 1.1. I think that is since I added better collision but never used it and increased it's version number. Just know that is GEOTEC 1.0.

This version of GEOTEC is no longer being updated. You can still make games and play around in it but I would not reccomend using this version since it is just democode and there are no development tools. If you would like, you could make some additions so making games is bearable. I would suggest:

- a basic map editor
- sound demo code
- screen scrolling
- just using GEOTEC 1.4 when I release it
- make a simple game
- rewrite some of the code so it is up to the pep-8 standard

Ironically, this is the only version of GEOTEC I have managed to make and releaase games on.
