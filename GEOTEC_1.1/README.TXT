context - Geotec_engine_rework is an old verison of GEOTEC_1.1.

This version of GEOTEC is disconinued and is also pretty much completely unusable if you are actually trying to make a game. You can do it but first you would want to strip out the engine part of the engine. I have no reccomendations for improvements, as this is the worst version of GEOTEC to use. Instead use:

- If you want tons of devtools, use 1.3 or 1.4
- If you want something lightweight, use 1.0
- if you want one where every tile is its own independent thing, use 1.2
